# PROG3 Library Management

One of my project at HEI

# Usage

To use this, you have to setup 3 variabale:
- POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/library_management
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456 (replace with your password)
- POSTGRES_USERNAME=prog_admin (replace with your username)

Then you can use all files migrations to create all resources.
